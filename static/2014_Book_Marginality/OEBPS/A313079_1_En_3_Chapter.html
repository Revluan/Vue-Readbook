            </h2><div class="Para">Literature on the ‘economics of exclusion’ typically addresses competition and the anti-trust laws of developed economies, not the ‘exclusion’ that development practitioners are concerned about. When economists do engage in the discourse on exclusion in development, they typically deal with poverty and deprivation without always applying the basic analytical tools available in economics (Sen <cite><a href="#CR00037">2000</a></cite>; Osmani <cite><a href="#CR00035">2003</a></cite>). In this chapter I make an effort to reconstruct the definition of exclusion and its various facets by applying a set of principles that underlie economic analyses. Though poverty is not directly dealt with in this paper, it is hoped that a concept of exclusion defined within the allegedly ‘narrow’ construct of economics can be ‘broad’ enough to encompass real deprivation, and provide additional insight into our understanding of the marginality that underlies the poverty observed in society.</div><div class="Para">Concern with exclusion surfaces in several domains of knowledge and related discourse appears fragmented, with little meaningful exchange across disciplines. A more comprehensive understanding of exclusion can be achieved by applying the basic principles of investigation common to various disciplines within economics and the social sciences. In the first part of this paper I take a cue from a critique of approaches in economics by orienting the discussion on ‘goods and services’ within the broader canvass of ‘contracts.’<a href="#Fn00032" id="Fn00032_source"><sup>2</sup></a> In such a setting, I define exclusion as the ‘exclusion of an agent from the set of all viable contracts in a given sphere.’</div><div class="Para">There has been an accumulation of rich experiences from development endeavors that have dealt with targeted programs, where the target populations were often ‘excluded’ groups. Some experiences suggest that there is a plethora of programs that suffer from inadequate planning; and there are programs that work for one segment of a target group but fail to reach others. Attempts to identify target groups and transfer resources or services to them via ‘out-of-system’ approaches have often fostered local divisiveness instead of leading to the desired reconfiguration of the social groups and reduced exclusion. In order to take the discourse ahead for formulating meaningful applicable measures there is a need to find common language, to reconstruct our ideas around ‘exclusion’ and to reconstruct the observed phenomena and draw inferences from a ‘model-dependent reality’ (in a comparative static setting) to guide possible actions.</div><div class="Para">In the first part of the paper I focus on the reconstruction of basic concepts, and in the second part I extend the analysis to classify exclusion, illustrated in the context of a service market and conceptualized with supply and demand tools. The exercise provides an opportunity to identify various options for reducing exclusion that have obvious linkages to familiar development programs and policies. The latter reveals that many initiatives to reduce exclusion under the umbrella of safety nets often lead to the introduction of differentiated products in segmented markets that may actually contribute towards perpetuating differentiations within a population. It is hoped that the proposed approach will improve the ability to design programs that effectively reduce exclusion (and poverty) as well as to evaluate program performance.<a href="#Fn00033" id="Fn00033_source"><sup>3</sup></a>

I refer to these people or social groups as ‘excluded,’ and to the broader subject of study as ‘exclusion.’</div><div class="Para">There are numerous programs under governments, the private sector, or NGOs, to reduce exclusion, some of which are associated with poverty reduction. The fact that these programs are often designed based on the assumption that the target groups were ‘excluded’ from regular service delivery networks and may become ‘included’ through specially designed programs, implies that ‘exclusion’ may be overcome. There are ample claims of program success, implying the achievement of ‘inclusion’ of individuals and groups that were formerly ‘excluded.’ Acceptance of such rationale renders exclusion less rigid than the perception that exclusion is rooted in the static (or slowly changing) framework of culture. This inference from development practices provides the key entry point to the reformulation of the analytics within a ‘model-dependent realism.’<a href="#Fn00035" id="Fn00035_source"><sup>5</sup></a> Given an initial equilibrium setting, exclusion is defined and programs to reduce exclusion are identified by applying comparative static economic analyses.</div></div><div id="Sec00034" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3.2.2 </span>Fragmented Perspective: Reflections on Trends in Knowledge Domain</h3><div class="Para">Some question the relevance of abstract economic theory and consider this realm as too narrow to apply to broader issues. Some advocate a pluralist pedagogy to expose students “to the competing currents of economic thought, e.g., classical, neoclassical, Keynesian, Marxian and institutionalist” (Stilwell <cite><a href="#CR00038">2006</a></cite>). Development practices have also found inroads into pluralist curricula, with gender, the environment, and poverty analysis being some of the important ones. All of these are considered means of making students aware of the different ways of looking at economic processes, problems, and policies. While diversity opens doors to fresh ideas, our failure to enrich the core elements of unity often leads to fragmented views, and this may often lead to divisiveness.<a href="#Fn00036" id="Fn00036_source"><sup>6</sup></a> In a small way the current exercise on exclusion returns to the basics of economics rooted in early political philosophy and reconstructs the analytics of an overriding concern of development practitioners with the hope that some guidelines for action may be derived. The search for common unity is justified because ‘exclusion’ is being articulated among diverse disciplines that lack adequate means of communication for broader discussion.</div></div><div id="Sec00035" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3.2.3 </span>Taking a Step Back—A Note on Core Economic Principles</h3><div class="Para">Engaging in a detailed assessment of the various perspectives on economics involves the challenging tasks of addressing multiple fields of epistemology and the history of economic thought, and their roots in early (post European Renaissance) political philosophy and economic theory of various ideologies. I use a set of principles below that constitute the core of economics.<a href="#Fn00037" id="Fn00037_source"><sup>7</sup></a> These principles are similar to those embedded in methods that are deemed necessary for knowledge building in other fields of social science.
<div class="OrderedList"><div class="ListItem"><span class="ItemNumber">1.</span><div class="ItemContent"><div class="Para">A basic analytical category or entity called an ‘agent’ is used to represent entities such as a social class, households, individuals, communities, governments, or political parties, etc. Each agent is assumed to have a pre-defined objective. The choice of agents and their objective ‘functions’ (mappings) are related.<a href="#Fn00038" id="Fn00038_source"><sup>8</sup></a>
                      </div></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></div><div class="ListItem"><span class="ItemNumber">2.</span><div class="ItemContent"><div class="Para">Agents are considered ‘rational’ only to the extent that their actions are guided by the pursuit of (optimizing) some transformed value of their objectives under a set of constraints. Actions or decisions made by agents may only be defined over the space in which the objective functions are defined.</div></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></div><div class="ListItem"><span class="ItemNumber">3.</span><div class="ItemContent"><div class="Para">Exchanges between agents can take place under various structures of power relations, but are sustainable only if all parties in the exchange ‘gain’ (strictly speaking) from such exchanges.</div></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></div></div>
              </div><div class="Para">These economic principles underlie most, if not all, other disciplines in the social sciences. Thus in the context of present-day discourse, ‘political economy’ (instead of political philosophy) may more appropriately capture the discipline under consideration. These principles are also relevant to the field of chemistry, where there are agents in the form of molecules, atoms or sub-atomic particles and chemical bondage may be construed as some form of contract between these agents. Scientists recognize the need to move beyond ‘scientific determinism’ and the ‘system of laws’ to a model-dependent realism that may generate ‘multiple histories’ depending on the assumptions made.<a href="#Fn00039" id="Fn00039_source"><sup>9</sup></a>
              </div></div><div id="Sec00036" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3.2.4 </span>Exchanges, Markets, Contracts, and Goods and Services</h3><div class="Para">Exchanges involve transactions in two or more directions that involve two or more agents. The time and space contingent flows of goods and services that define exchanges, and the terms and conditions of such exchanges, together constitute ‘contracts,’ and such contracts are negotiated between various agents at different spheres of life. Within the proposed perspective it is obvious that goods and services are one aspect of a contract and they are real when they are elements of viable contracts. Our constructs of time and space (and often quality) contingent commodities accommodate additional dimensions of contracts, and yet all feasible elements of a contract are not exhausted.</div><div class="Para">Contemporary analysis of markets also recognizes the specifics of non-market exchanges, blurring the distinctions between market and non-market exchanges. Rhee (<cite><a href="#CR00036">2010</a></cite>) distinguishes relational exchanges from market exchanges. Yet the “trust, friendship, fraternity or solidarity” that defines relational exchanges is also found in modern-day market exchanges, making it difficult to distinguish non-market from market based exchanges. What may constitute an exchange and what kinds of exchanges define markets, are less formally (and less explicitly) articulated in economics textbooks. It is no wonder that ‘classical’ economists vying to break away to a simpler ground of analytics pondered extensively on such terms as ‘exchange’ and ‘value’ before settling with ‘goods and services,’ an <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ex post</span> manifestation of a contract, and with a concept of price (financial) that is one of many dimensions of that contract. While discussing markets, which is often the starting point for an intermediate textbook, the necessity of identifying <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">a priori</span>, the goods and services that are being exchanged is realized. However, it is also recognized that all exchanges are not market-based and thus the definition that the ‘market is a place where exchanges take place’ appears too hollow.</div><div class="Para">For our purpose ‘market’ is relevant in an <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ex post</span> analysis only when there are predefined goods and services for which there are predefined agents on both sides (providers and consumers). While such a category is resorted to in the latter part of the paper, the primary focus is on contracts that embody exchanges, be those via ‘markets’ or not. A more pertinent question relates to the motive behind engaging in contracts. What drives agents to negotiate contracts with other agents is embedded in their ‘objectives’ and the ‘constraints’ within which those objectives are realized. For the purpose of this analysis, I presume that ‘contracts’ and exchanges among various agents are driven by self-interest.<a href="#Fn000310" id="Fn000310_source"><sup>10</sup></a> Thus there is no transaction other than as exchanges—that is, there is no unidirectional transfer from one agent to another without a matching counter-flow.</div><div class="Para">Historically, discourses on social contracts moved to market-based analyses in economics, often at the cost of a broader understanding of the subject. Subsequently the shift in focus from market to contracts in the economic discourse provided new insights, but largely ran parallel to the market-based analyses with no observable attempt to reconcile the two.<a href="#Fn000311" id="Fn000311_source"><sup>11</sup></a> A contract defines the characteristics of the goods or services being exchanged between two or more agents. Thus the search for a viable contract between two or more agents requires identifying the goods and services that may be offered. This approach to address a problem is <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ex ante</span> in nature and much more akin to traditional ‘business models.’<a href="#Fn000312" id="Fn000312_source"><sup>12</sup></a> In contrast, what emerged due to the switch to market-based analyses was the dominance of an <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ex post</span> perspective: goods and services are considered predefined and exchanges between providers or producers and consumers take place at terms (prices) that ensure net benefits to both parties. Both approaches are considered valid and useful as long as their corresponding aspects are recognized and the limitations of singular focus on either is acknowledged.</div><div class="Para">The observed arrangements of ‘contracts’ among multiple agents in multiple spheres may be considered as equilibrium outcomes in accordance with the concept of (abstract) market equilibrium. Underlying an equilibrium are: the agents included in a model, the assumptions related to their objectives, the constraints they face in the forms of resource endowments or technology available for production and distribution (delivery), and the assumptions about power relations amongst the various agents.<a href="#Fn000313" id="Fn000313_source"><sup>13</sup></a> More importantly equilibrium may include the exclusion of one or more agents from viable contracts, making exclusion an equilibrium outcome. A new equilibrium may be established if any of the parameters mentioned above change (e.g., introduction of a new agent, innovative mechanisms that reduce cost, changes in objective function, etc.). The resulting new equilibrium may reduce exclusion in one sphere and increase exclusion in some other sphere. Alternatively viewed, one may design programs to change the setting in ways that reduce exclusion of an agent in a given sphere.</div></div></div><div id="Sec00037" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3.3 </span>Contracts, Goods and Services, and Exclusion</h2><div class="Para">Suppose there are ‘i’ categories of agents in a society, the i-th being identified as Λ<sub>i</sub> (i = 1, 2, … i). The simplest case of exclusion arises when there is a provider of a service and all but one type of agents avail themselves of the service. That is, contracts could be negotiated with all of those agents, but no feasible contract could be defined for (or negotiated with) the ‘excluded’ group. Social exclusion may be interpreted as exclusion in one space as a result of social contracts in multiple spaces within a given power relationship. Thus a ‘socially excluded’ group may have contracts in other spheres of the economy. Only in extreme cases of exclusion, where a group is alienated by all others, would the excluded group face extinction, or go into complete isolation and establish an alternative society, or create conflict for the mainstream (causing negative welfare) so that the latter is forced to renegotiate. In all these cases there is a set of predefined agents and a power relationship (jointly referred to as a ‘system’), and exclusion may be defined as the presence of an ‘agent’ who is unable to negotiate a viable contract in a given sphere involving other agents in that ‘system.’ Below we use an applied research effort to provide a skill development program for urban domestic workers who were ‘excluded’ from regular education to illustrate the relationships between contracts, goods and services, and exclusion.</div><div class="Para">The author and several colleagues assessed the prospect of offering a tutoring and skill development program for domestic workers in the city of Dhaka. In most cases the domestic workers are school-age females whose parents were financially compelled to send them to work. Normally the work arrangement does not include any obligation on the employer to ensure the education of these child workers. It was noted, however, that there are employers who are keen to support the education of the children working at their homes. However, these desires did not materialize in most cases due to the absence of a favorable community environment and the perception among employers that a suitable arrangement could be reached at little or no cost arising from frequent travels by the children outside of their workplace. In other words, these workers were ‘excluded’ from traditional education means due to prevailing contracts among relevant stakeholders. Based on anecdotal evidence it was postulated that there were employers who would be willing to pay for tutoring their employees and that a contract (a program with a service package) could be defined that would reduce exclusion among the working children. The basic framework for identifying the feasible contract to reduce exclusion is described below.</div><div class="Para">There were three important stakeholders relevant for the purpose of the exercise: domestic workers, employers, and the committees that manage the affairs of each apartment building.<a href="#Fn000314" id="Fn000314_source"><sup>14</sup></a> The variables assigned to the three were ‘w,’ ‘e,’ and ‘c’ respectively. Any resulting program would have to be introduced by a service provider (represented by ‘s’). Additional terms can be added to describe other variables, such as: the regulatory regime, other actors (drivers, security guards, etc.) in an apartment building, and the general environment (law and order situation) in the neighborhood.</div><div class="Para">While an optimization problem could be used to solve for a possible comparative static analysis, for our purposes only the incentive compatibility issues were addressed to assess whether the set of viable contracts was null or non-null. This allows for remediating the exclusion of domestic workers from some form of education. We let ‘Z’ be the vector of the current contract that describes the influence of domestic worker variables (work hours, types of activities to be performed, payment received, holidays available, and mobility), employers’ preferences and costs, the state of community variables (facilities available in the apartment building, etc.), and service providers (training or class schedule, payments, etc.), which were initially set to zeros.<a href="#Fn000315" id="Fn000315_source"><sup>15</sup></a>

Specifically, stakeholder willingness was responsive to: variation in the hours offered for tutoring or training, the age of domestic workers, the venue of classes, and the characteristics of the service provider. Proponents of the particular experiment believed that once an initial entry point was utilized and the positive benefits became apparent to relevant stakeholders, that the exclusion of urban domestic workers from education would be reduced at a broader level.</div></div><div id="Sec00038" class="Section1 RenderAsSection1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3.4 </span>Types of Exclusion: Illustration with Service Demand and Supply</h2><div id="Sec00039" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3.4.1 </span>General Setting</h3><div class="Para">The presence of agents with whom no viable contract may be negotiated in a given sphere by any other agent is meant to establish the existence of exclusion. The search for viable contracts is meant to reduce exclusion. It is however important to recognize that exclusion may arise for different reasons, necessitating different remedial measures. It is therefore necessary to categorize exclusion accordingly, so that programs or actions to reduce exclusion may be appropriately designed. In this section I use basic demand supply tools to illustrate the various types and options.</div><div class="Para">Consider a service ‘x.’ Each individual in a population may consume only one unit of x, or none at all.<a href="#Fn000318" id="Fn000318_source"><sup>18</sup></a> Those who consume x are considered ‘included’ and those who do not consume x, either voluntarily or involuntarily, are considered ‘excluded.’ Without delving into individual optimization leading to a threshold price below which one unit of x is availed of by an individual, I directly define a market demand function as:

I differentiate this from voluntary exclusion, since the choice is ‘structurally imposed’ by initial ownership of endowments. If p = c = 0; φ = φ (N<sub>2</sub>), t &gt; 0 and M can take finite positive value, then D = N<sub>3</sub> &lt; N<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>2</sub> – N<sub>3</sub> (see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00031">3.1</a></span>).</div><div class="Para">
                <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Type 4</span>: <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">exclusion due to the lack of effective demand under positive prices</span>. If one could control for all the three types of exclusion discussed above, all forms of social exclusion and those arising out of costly connectivity (discussed later), we would be left with the possibility of exclusion as a result of a lack of effective demand. This case is illustrated in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00032">3.2</a></span> and assumes that prices received by main market suppliers are equal to those paid by end consumers. Of those agents (consumers) with positive effective demand at non-negative prices, (q<sub>1</sub> q<sub>2</sub>) are unable to avail themselves of the service at a market price of P<sub>0</sub>.

While the previous four types of exclusion are fairly straightforward, lumping together ‘social exclusion’ with exclusion caused by physical distance (from growth centers) and/or the lack of appropriate or efficient delivery mechanisms may be controversial. Reducing the concepts of exclusion (including that of social exclusion) to tractable cost equivalence is not meant to undermine the importance of the processes that generate exclusion. It is important to note that the subject of exclusion is also of interest to development practitioners because they believe that exclusion may be reversed and that there are costs involved for all such efforts towards inclusion. The equivalence of the two types of exclusion may be argued on the grounds that both arise due to ‘distance,’ one in social space and the other in physical space. Thus from a purely technical perspective (using supply and demand tools), the cost of including the socially excluded is no different from the cost of the ‘delivery’ to a consumer in a distant market. In both cases an excluded person would have to pay in addition to the ‘normal’ price and the latter critically depends on the delivery system in place.</div><div class="Para">The horizontal supply line S<sub>e</sub> in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00032">3.2</a></span> is meant to represent socially excluded (SE) people under the assumptions of delivery at zero price and the effective demand of socially excluded persons are represented by the lowest segment of the demand curve. There is an interesting twist to the story in this particular case. When SE people are represented by the lower end of the demand curve, market forces (supply-side agents) may be less keen on changing the status quo and they would even be less keen if inclusion of the SE has negative effects on the willingness to pay at the upper end of the curve. Clearly increases in resource endowments of cash, assets, or intellectual capital among SEs will change the distribution of SE along the demand curve and market forces may be more eager to remove social exclusion.<a href="#Fn000322" id="Fn000322_source"><sup>22</sup></a>

Innovations in service delivery, improved connectivity reducing delivery cost, and/or wider acceptance of the formerly excluded social groups would all push the S curve downward (or shift the D<sub>1</sub> curve to the right towards D<sub>0</sub>), thus reducing exclusion.

Sources of such shifts are rooted in various kinds of policies and changes in the market environment. A summary of options to reduce various kinds of exclusion are summarized in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00034">3.4</a></span>. If exclusion is voluntary the urge to reduce exclusion may be justified if the social benefits from inclusion are perceived to be higher than the costs perceived by private individuals opting for exclusion. In such cases individual action may be influenced either by motivating changes in the objective function of excluded agents or by providing incentives (if the cost of the latter is less than the perceived net social benefits). Similarly the second and third types of exclusion may be addressed by promoting awareness through networks and by addressing competing factors respectively (e.g., excusing school-age children from daily household chores).

Traditionally we are introduced to two basic interrelated criteria that are also used for assessing program performance or efficiency: the cost of reducing exclusion and the efficacy of targeting. While these are important, the obvious implications of targeted programs for creating differentiated spaces or products in the market and society are often overlooked.</div><div class="Para">As noted earlier the current availability of goods and services subsumes a balance between agents with existing contracts (included) and agents with whom no viable contract could be negotiated (excluded). Any attempt to expand service coverage beyond a market-determined level calls for new contracts to be negotiated. In this case the corresponding goods and services may no longer be considered identical to the old ones. Several cases are discussed below to illustrate this situation.</div><div class="Para">The case of a perfectly discriminating monopoly is well-known amongst economists. In this scenario no new product is introduced, but the market is segmented to ensure greater profit to a monopolist, which also leads to the reduction of exclusion (in contrast to a competitive solution). Without reductions in the cost of producing or delivering a given good or service, coverage may be expanded (exclusion reduced) by introducing new goods and services of lower quality at lower cost.<a href="#Fn000323" id="Fn000323_source"><sup>23</sup></a> Sometimes funds may be provided to extend an ‘existing’ product or service (e.g., primary education or sanitary toilets) to a targeted (excluded) population through a new contract with an additional agent (e.g., an NGO). Using a viable contract for reference and a corresponding product or service, the targeted program is more likely to give rise to a new contract and a service or product that is not same as the one originally meant to be delivered!</div><div class="Para">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00034">3.4</a></span> presents nine interventions with potentials to reduce exclusion. The implications of these interventions for segmentation were described in Figs. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00031">3.1</a></span>, <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00032">3.2</a></span>, and <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig00033">3.3</a></span>, where solutions were sought beyond ‘market-determined’ terms of exchange. Those are recast with explicit emphasis on segmentation and summarily presented in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab00031">3.1</a></span> above. At the practitioner level there is uncertainty about whether efforts towards inclusion can ever be completed. Or stated alternatively, does product differentiation introduced to ‘include’ subsequently lead to further segmentation? At the level of analysts and program evaluators a program may be fine-tuned (or have its performance assessed) on the basis of its degree of neutrality to or biases towards product differentiation and segmentation.<div id="Tab00031" class="Table"><div class="Caption" xml:lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 3.1</span><div class="SimplePara">Implications of various interventions on segmentations</div></div></div><table border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Intervention type</div></th><th align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Implication</div></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Innovation reducing production cost (1)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Inclusive in nature, no segmentation</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Price subsidy (2)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">If applied to all, inclusive: targeting requires segmentation</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Innovation introducing differentiated product (3)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Segments, which may be irreversible in the short- to medium-term and may percolate into other spheres</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Innovation in delivery that reduces cost of delivery (4)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Reduces segmentation</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Improve connectivity/reduce distance (5)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Reduces segmentation</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Promote/avail services of agencies with network capital (6)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">If governed properly, reduces cost of delivery and therefore reduces segmentation</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Social awareness (7)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">If rightly pitched, reduces social differences</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Increase income/transfers (8)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">If accompanied by reduced inequality, reduces segmentation</div></td></tr><tr class="noclass"><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Address competing factors (9)</div></td><td align="left"><div class="SimplePara">Reduces segmentation</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

The discord between textbook teaching of economics and development practices, further distorted by un-scrutinized inclusion of development issues into teaching, was one concern that led to this paper. The search for a set of core principles underlying various disciplines within ‘political economy’ was justified on the ground that ‘exclusion’ is being dealt with within those disciplines (breeding fragmented perspectives). Once these principles were laid out the rest of the paper followed the tradition of deductive reasoning.</div><div class="Para">Contracts embody exchanges that involve reciprocal transactions and are assumed to be driven by self-interest. This paper considered contracts to arise between various agents in a society in multiple economic and noneconomic spheres, and defined exclusion as the presence of one or more agents with whom viable contracts cannot be defined. ‘Contract’ as an analytical category was perceived more suitable a tool for <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ex ante</span> analysis, whereas ‘goods and services,’ identified as elements of viable contracts, provide the basis for <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ex post</span> analysis. Both routes of analysis were pursued in this paper to gain better insights into exclusion and for the design and assessment of programs to reduce exclusion. Although the subject was raised, this paper did not delve into the role of agencies (formal manifestation of agents above micro-levels) in introducing new forms of contracts. Nor did we pursue the arguments for identifying the areas of unity among various sub-branches of knowledge, particularly in economics, that are alleged to be ideologically tainted. It is hoped that the perspectives proposed in this paper will open avenues for such discourse in future.</div></div><div class="Bibliography" id="Bib00031"><div class="Heading">References</div><div class="BibliographyWrapper"><div class="Citation"><div class="CitationContent" id="CR00031">Brousseau E, Glachant JM (2002) The economics of contracts and the renewal of economics.
